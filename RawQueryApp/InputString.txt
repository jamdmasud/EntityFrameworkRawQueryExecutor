 
As a temporary solution, you should be able to edit the article one section at a time by using the "Edit" links you see next to each header in the article. This should work as long as none of the sections are longer than 32kB, which they really shouldn't be. You can edit text before the first section by editing the first section, then changing the &section=1 part of the URL to &section=0. (See T2156 and two JavaScript workarounds: 1, 2.) You can insert a new section either by using the "New section" link (if there is one) in the "Views" section, or by editing an existing section and explicitly adding a second header line within it. See also Section editing and Editing before the first section.
 If you find a section too long to edit correctly and safely, you can post a request for assistance on the help desk. Follow the "New section" link, which will allow you to post a new comment without editing any existing text.

This page contains an overview of the key issues concerning article size. There are three related measures of an article's size: 
Readable-prose size: the amount of viewable text in the main sections of the article, not including tables, lists, or footer sections
Wiki markup size: the amount of text in the full page edit window, as shown in the character count of the edit history page
Browser-page size: the total size of the page as loaded by a web browser
Usability considerations concerning the size of an article have been determined to include: 
Reader issues, such as attention span, readability, organization, information saturation, etc.
Editor issues, such as talkpage tension, arguments over trivial contributions, debates on how to split up a large article, etc.
